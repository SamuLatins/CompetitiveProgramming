# Competitive programming

In this repo are stored the solutions of problems I've solved as part of my training for [OII (Italian Olympiad in Informatics)](https://www.olimpiadi-informatica.it).

### How to navigate
The solutions are organized first by website and then by the problem's name.
There can be multiple solutions for the same problem, as for showing different methods or to display the solution of a subtask.
The code is not meant to be user friendly, the older you go and the more unreadable it gets!

Posto il codice di tutti i problemi risolti trovabili negli appunti:
